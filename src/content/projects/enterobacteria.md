### Context

The website, developed in partnership with microbiology professor Zilca and pharmacy student Jessica Gabriele, offers a helpful resource for identifying enterobacteria based on biochemical test results. This platform provides a user-friendly interface where professionals, including laboratory technicians, doctors, and researchers, can input their test results and receive corresponding enterobacterial identifications. 

By leveraging the collective expertise of microbiology and pharmacy, the website aims to simplify and improve the accuracy of bacterial identification in a practical and accessible manner. This collaborative project highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in addressing challenges in the field of microbiology and healthcare.
