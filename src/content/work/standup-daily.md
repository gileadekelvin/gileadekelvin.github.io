### Context
At my Daily job I realized that instead of doing a simple TODO application to study, I could do something more complex. Then I decided to develop a complete application that will provide a Daily Meeting plataform to teams that are working remotely. I learned a lot during the development of this application. 

### Decisions
On the backend I used GraphQL with Apollo Server and it was a great experience. On the frontend I decided to use Nextjs with Relay. Setup Relay properly was not easy, but my experience with Nextjs worked very well.
